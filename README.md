# PythonProjects
Random python projects for fun.

This project will find trends in a recursive manner meaning:

There is a "search loop" where it will look for similar words to items you already found.

As an example, if the loop is 0, it will only get the trendy searches. If the look count is 1 it will search for the trends and then similar words to those trends. It is a recursive kind of process.
